Hi. I’m Daryl.  I’m on a journey to downsize and live a better life. Here I share this story with you on how I observe things and then I talk about them. I’m hoping we can live better lives through this process. Will you join me?

I grew up pretty independent, which really sparked my curiosity about technology. I’ve always loved diving into new projects and exploring what I could create. But on the weekends, I’d trade my screens for the mountains, seeking adventure and inspiration in nature. I really enjoy that balance—finding challenges in both the tech world and the great outdoors.
