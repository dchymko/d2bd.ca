<h2>What's with the name?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The name was the brainchild of two others who know my fondness of good raisin bran muffin.  They were discussing the new and yet-to-be-named van and said something along the lines of "does he just drive around in it eating bran muffins? Bran muffins in his van, the BranVan?" The van is a 2020 model-year, so it was then christened BranVan2020.</p>

<h2>Why such a small van?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the sudden demise of the Sprinter in January 2020, I started re-thinking what parts of #vanlife were important to me.  After reflecting, I realized that size and extravagance isn't as important to me as I thought.  What is important is having a self-contained "basecamp" that serves as a mobile spot to conduct my may wilderness adventures. I don't know when exactly I discovered the "microcampers" trend but it felt like the choice that aligned best with what I wanted. </p>

<p>The project is an experiment in campervan-minimalism, aka trying to distill all of the elements of a campervan into a tiny,  fuel-efficient footprint. Will it work out?  Follow along and see!</p>

<h2>It doesn't really look like a campervan</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That's because it isn't.  It's <strong>totally</strong> just another cargo van, there's definitely not a bed and a sink and a stove or someone sleeping in there. Nothing to see here, move along. :)</p>
