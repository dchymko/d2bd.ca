<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Morning People: you know that feeling you get after completing a task before everyone else has woken up? Night people get that too after everyone has gone to bed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Night people: That aversion you have to setting your alarm to 6am?  Morning people get that when invited to a dinner party starting at 8pm</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Different flows for different people. It can even change for people as they move through life.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ignore those "10 things all successful people  do" lists.  It's just noise. </p>
