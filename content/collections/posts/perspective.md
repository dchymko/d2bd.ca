<p>Remember the scene from Wall-E with all the overweight peopl watching screens and drinking/eating while being moved along in chairs on a conveyor ? And how we laughed and thought it was a funny prediction of how lazy people really could be?</p>

<p>But then how many of us after the movie or in the days or weeks after, got back into our cars for a short ride home?  Its almost the same thing, but slightly less futuristic in that we actually have to press pedals and turn the steering wheel.</p>

<p>When I first moved into my place in Vernon, I was driving the 1.8km trip to and from work.  The thought of walking or biking didn't even occur to me, because I was so used to driving everywhere.But then I started walking and biking, initially as a way to get more exercise. But now for short trips, especially to work, I feel like it would be _crazy_ to get in my car</p>

<p>When I drop my vehicle off for servicing, and decline the shuttle because I say I'm walking or taking the bus, I'm met with a look of surprise. In fact, its almost disbelief, and I'm usually askied "are you sure" several times.  I realize some of this is just them trying maintain a high level of helpfulness and service but its an echo of our society that walking or getting somewhere without hoping into a car is just a CRAZY idea.</p>

<p>And then you stop and think about it and realize. Is it really that crazy to have to spend 10 minutes to walk somewhere?</p>
