<h2>The 10 guiding principles</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"className":"is-style-default"} -->
<ol class="is-style-default"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Consume less. Create more</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Get rid of <a href="https://dayoneapp.com/blog/five-tips-for-keeping-a-gratitude-journal/">many of your things</a> (or at least your attachments to them)</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Focus on habits and <a href="https://markmanson.net/goals">systems</a>. Goals are great as a "north star" but you want to create a regiment that makes them effortless to attain.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Start a <a href="https://dayoneapp.com/blog/five-tips-for-keeping-a-gratitude-journal/">gratitude journal</a></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Practice activities that facilitate mindfulness (mediation, yoga)</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Dream big, but start small. Many plans fail due to being overwhelmed and not knowing where to start. Chip off a piece (any piece), and start there.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Get really clear on your <strong>values</strong>. Make a list of them (on paper)&nbsp; Rank them in order.&nbsp; Refer to it when making big decisions like moving, careers or relationships. Physically look at this list, do not try to recall it from memory.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Bring your ego <a href="http://egoistheenemy.com/">down a notch</a>. Even if you think it's already exceptionally low.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Unless you work in a physical job, maybe re-think retirement. It's a capitalist construct to extract maximum labour from you in your good years. Consider doing the things earlier in life that you put off for retirement.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>When a risk or life choice keeps coming up as a recurring theme, maybe its something to listen to. "Do it now. Sometimes later becomes never." </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Getting back your time</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"className":"is-style-default"} -->
<ol class="is-style-default"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Delete your Facebook account. Trust me, your personal life and business will be okay. </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>"How you setup your phone's home screen is how you live your life." Replace social media with books, podcasts, fitness apps. Or even better:</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Delete all social apps from your phone. Use the web versions. Yes, some have less features, but using the web version makes it a more intentional behaviour. </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Move your chat groups from social media into iMessage, Signal, Telegram, or WhatsApp. </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Avoid the "passive" friendships/relationships on social media where you just observe people in a feed. Connect one-on-one as much as possible. </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Turn off <strong>all</strong> notifications from all of your apps. Be ruthless with this. Your phone is a constant attention-sucking device. </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Money</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>When buying something that seems cheap or a good deal, look at the future (total) costs. For a new car, check out the maintenance schedule, price out new tires for it.  For a printer, check out how much toner will cost. Often times this far exceed the purchase price.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Don't buy the <a href="https://www.squawkfox.com/extended-warranty/">extended warranty</a>, it's overpriced peace of mind. Instead put aside the equivalent amount into a investment or saving account. Worst case scenario, you use it for repairs, but more than likely you will keep a majority of it. Take yourself on a vacation with the money to reward yourself for making good choices</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Always view large purchases/expenditures in terms of the amount of life (hours worked) to obtain it: "The price of anything is the amount of life you exchange for it." - Henry David Thoreau</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>

<p>Isn't it a little crazy that we defer living life in the present for the promise of being able to one day do all those things we dreamed of?</p>
