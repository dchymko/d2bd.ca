<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A lot of people think a brand as your logo, your Instagram handle, or the tone you use posting on social media. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your brand is not your business cards, your swag, or even the things that you sell. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These tangible pieces are only a small part of it. Flashy public things, the trim and the decoration. The bling. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What your brand really is at the core is your values, your behaviours, and how you treat business partners, colleagues, and customers. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>And most importantly: your brand is how you conduct yourself when nobodyâ€™s watching. </p>
