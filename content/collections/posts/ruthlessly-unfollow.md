<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don't be afraid to unfollow people who no longer bring you value. This not only applies to social media, but to all aspects in life.  I don't view this as being "disloyal." In fact I think it actually means being <em>more</em> loyal to those who you do include in your life. It gives you more time and attention to focus on those who matter most.</p>

<p>So less guilt-follows and more genuine follows.</p>
